# SFG-Orientation
Mathematical formula of Sum Frequency Generation process and molecular orientation
## 1. Sum Frequency Generation Process
Sum frequency generation (SFG) is a coherent second-order nonlinear process which involves three photons of visible, infrared (IR), and SFG, at a surface. Using SFG molecular orientation on a surface can be determined.

 Spectral magnitudes of SFG are directly proportional to the induced second-order nonlinear dipole moment per unit volume, , by the two incident light fields.
